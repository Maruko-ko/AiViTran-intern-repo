```
    function divide(a,b) {
        return a/b;
    }
```
## What was the issue with the original code?
The issue with that function is it does not check for invalid inputs, such as dividing by zero or non-numeric values.This can leads to unexpected results, runtime errors, or bugs thar are hard to trace and fix.
## How does handling errors improve readability?
By making it clear how the function deals with unexpected situations. It shows what will happen if invalid inputs are provided, making the code behavior easier to understand.
