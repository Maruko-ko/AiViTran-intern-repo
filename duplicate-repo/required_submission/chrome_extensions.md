## Which extensions did I install? Why?

I installed all 4 extensions listed in the task (React Developer Tools, Redux DevTools, JSON Viewer, and Lighthouse). This is my first time using them, and I plan to integrate them into my regular development workflow to explore their features and experience their strengths, which are already described in the task. After working with them for a while, I will provide detailed feedback on how effective they are, howeasy they are to use, and how they improve my productivity.

## What are the most useful thing I learned?

The most useful thing I learned from setting up these extensions is that they can make my work easier by helping me debug, check data, and test performance right inside the browser. React Developer Tools lets me look at how React components are built and what data they have (especially when my position mainly works on React). Redux DevTools helps me follow how the app's data changes over time. JSON Viewer makes API responses look neat and easy to read. Lighthouse checks the website's speed, accessibility, and other important factors, then give tips to improve them. Even though this is my first time using these tools, I can see how they could help me work faster and make my code better.
