## Research anf Learn:
### Who are considered vulberable populations, and what challenges might theyface in digital spaces?
- **vulnerable population:** neurodivergent individuals (ADHD, AUtism, Dyslexia), people with mental health condition, elderly users, and individuals with low digital litercacy.
- **Challenges faced:** sensory overload, complex navigation, unclear instructions, inaccessibility 

### Ethical considerations whrn designing/working with neurodivergent individulas
- **Avoid overwhelming UX:** minimize clutter, use consistent layouts
- **Respect sensory needs:** Avoid flashing animations, offerdark mode/light mode options
- **Ensure clarity:** use simple, direct language and predictable flow
- **Promote autonomy:** give users control over pacing, reminders, and customisation
- **Protect dignity:** design with empathy and avoid stereotypes or infantilization

### Making interactions and content more accessible for ADHD/Autism
- Break content into small, digestible steps.
- Use **predictable navigation** and consistent terminology
- Reduce cognitive laod with clear calls-to-action and minimal distractions
- Provide **visual supports** (icons, highlights, progress indicators)
- Allow flexible settings for notifications, reminders, and pacing 
### Supporting neurodivergent team members
- Be explicit and concis communication-avoid ambiguity
- Respect different working styles (some way prefer async, others more structured check-ins)
- Allow flexibility in deadlines and work environments where possible 
- Create psychological safety for disclosure and discussion of needs
- Normalise using tools (timers, task boards, reminders) that benefit everyone

## Reflection
### Adjusting my communication style
- Use **clear, step-by-step instructions** when assigning or sharing tasks.
- Avoid ovewhelming teammates with too much information at once - chunk it into smaller updates
- Check understanding without judgement by asking open, supportive questions like **Would it help if I clarified this steps?**

### Common pitfalls in UX or communication
- Overlaoding dashboards with too much info at once
- Using vague wording like "soon" or "later" without specifics
- Notifications that are too frequent or not customizable
- Interfaces that are visually cluttered or inconsistent.

### One practical change I can make
I will **use simpler, more structured written communication** - whether in Slack updates or documentation - so both users and teamates can follow instructions more easily.

## Task
### First-person account (summary)
I read a blog post from a person with ADHD describing how many productivity apps make them feel guilty when they miss tasks. They preferred tools that **focus on encouragement, gentle reminders, and flexibility**, instead of rigid structures that increase shame.

### Design/communication improvement
Introduce **gentle, encouraging language** in reminders and progress tracking (e.g., *“You made progress today—well done!”* instead of *“You failed to complete your task”*).

### Practice supportive response
*Hypothetical user message:*  
> “I keep setting up tasks in Focus Bear but then I forget about them and feel like I’m failing.”  

*Supportive response:*  
“Thanks for sharing that with us—it’s completely normal to feel this way. Focus Bear is here to support you, not to make you feel pressured. You might find it helpful to set smaller steps or adjust reminders to a pace that feels comfortable. Would you like me to walk you through how to customize reminders so they feel less overwhelming?”
## Key Learning
Inclusive design is about **empathy, flexibility, and clarity**. By making small, intentional choices—like simplifying language, reducing clutter, and offering gentle encouragement—we can make Focus Bear a tool that supports vulnerable populations with dignity and respect.
