## What makes a good commit message?
It should be a clear, concise, and descriptive, explaining what changes were made and why, which making it easy for the team to undestand and follow what had other changes in the previous commit.
## How does a clear commit message help in team collaboration?
It helps other team members to keep track of what is happening in the project (are there any issues, bugs are introduced into the program). Also easier to inspect the code's function. By using commands like ##`git log`##, the team can easily reach out for help if there is any source of code that is not clear.
## How can poor commit messages cause issues later?
Harder to debugging and take it a bit more time for other to keep track with what had been done or what is going on in the program.
