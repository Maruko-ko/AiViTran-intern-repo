## i18next reflection
### What challenge did I face while setting ip i18next?
The main challenge was understanding the initial configuration and where to place the translation resources. Another difficulty was remembering to wrap the app in `i18n` setup so that translations were available globally. Also, it took some time to understand how interpolation works for inserting dynamic values into translation.

## Why is it important to use library like i18nest instead of manually handling translations?
Usinf i18next provides a structured, scalable approach ro internationalisaption. If I handled trnalations manually, I would habe to write a lot of boilerplate code, create my own interpolation logic, and manage switching language manually. i18next provides these features out of the box, making the porject more maintainable and less error-prone.

## How would I handle dynamic content in a multilingual app?
Dynamic user-generated content usually connot be translate automatically with static resources. To handle this, I would:
- Store the original content in the language it was written.
- Use third-party translation APIs (like Google Translate API or DeepL) if automatic translation is acceptable.
- For critical content, consider providing translation workflows where human translators can add localized versions.
This ensures flexibility while still supporting multiple languages for dynamic content.
