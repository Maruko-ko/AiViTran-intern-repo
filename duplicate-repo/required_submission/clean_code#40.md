## When should I add comments?
When there is complex, or when I think this code is needed to be explained for the other members in the team. Maybe save for later debuging and understanding the code logic after long time not using.
## When should I avoid comments and instead improve the code?
When the code can be made clearer by using better variable names, function names, or simplifying logic.
