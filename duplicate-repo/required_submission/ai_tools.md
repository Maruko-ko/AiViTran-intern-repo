## Which AI tools did I try?

- I chose GitHub Copilot as my main Ai coding assistant to help generate the skeleton for my coding projects and assist in debugging. It worked well for quickly generating repetitive code, and pointing me toward possible debugging.
- I also use ChatGPT to get explanations on programming concepts, ask coding questions, and exlore different approaches to solving problems.

## What worked well? What didn't?

Since Copilot has access to my code base, it can give context-aware suggestions, making it easier to ask for help and get relevant answers in a short time. However, some of its suggestions did not fully work, so I had to review, understand and adjust the code. ChatGPT was very helpful for breaking down complex topics into simplier explanations, providing relevant examples,and giving alternative solutions. The main drawback with ChatGPT is that sometimes it create the fake or incorrect information so I had to verify them before use.

## When do I think AI is most useful for coding?

Both GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are most useful for speeding up the initial setup of a projectm generating repetitive code, assisting with debugging, and explaining unfamiliar concepts. They are best used as support tools alongside my own knowledge to ensure the final code is accurate, efficient, and maintainable.
