## What does ##git bisect## do?

It is used to identify the bug that was introduced to the program by performinf a binary search beterrn a known good commit and a bad commit.
Which helps developers to save time during the debugging session.

## When whould I use it in a real-world debugging situation?

When the code worked well last time but there is an error showing up and we need to find which commit that started causing the bug. With that command, developers don't need to check one by one manually.

## How does it compare to manually reviewing commits?

It saves more time when using the command instead of comparing or check manually.
