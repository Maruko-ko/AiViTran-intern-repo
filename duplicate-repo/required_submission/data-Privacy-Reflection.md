## Why is this important?
Focus Bear handles sensitive user data and company information that must be protected. Mishandling data can cause **privacy breaches, loss of user trust, reputational harm, and potential legal or regulatory consequences**. As part of Focus Bear, it’s my responsibility to safeguard this information in line with company policies.

## Research and learn

### Best pratices for handling confidential data
- **Principle of least priviledge:** only access the data I need for a specific task.

- **Encrypt and anonymize:** ensure data is encrypted in transit and at rest, anonymize wherever possible.  
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** always enable MFA on accounts.  
- **Avoid local storage:** don’t download or store sensitive data on personal devices unless absolutely required.  
- **Clear desk policy:** lock screens, avoid leaving sensitive info visible in physical or digital spaces.  

### How to respond to a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure

3. **Report the incident right away** to Focus Bear’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) or designated contact.  
4. **Follow internal response procedures** — cooperate with the investigation and remediation steps.

## Reflection
#### Steps I can take to handle data securely
- Always double-check before sharing or storing files that may contain confidential information.  
- Keep work accounts separated from personal accounts.  
- Use password managers to maintain strong, unique passwords.  
- Stay updated on Focus Bear’s privacy policies and compliance requirements.  

### Safe ways to store, share, and dispose of sensitive information
- **Store:** in encrypted, company-approved platforms (e.g., secure cloud, protected databases).  
- **Share:** only via official, secure channels with authorized recipients.  
- **Dispose:** use secure deletion methods (digital shredding, wiping tools) or physical shredders for hard copies.  

### Common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues
- Using weak or reused passwords.  
- Sending sensitive data through unencrypted channels (e.g., personal email, public chat).  
- Leaving confidential files open or unattended.  
- Storing files on unsecured devices.  

**How to avoid them:**  
Use password managers, encryption, and awareness training; never bypass security protocols for convenience.

## Task
- **New habit:** I will **always enable MFA** on all accounts and verify before sharing any file containing sensitive information.  
- **Key learning:** Handling confidential data is not just a technical responsibility but also a **behavioral discipline** — staying cautious, minimizing risks, and reporting incidents promptly are essential to maintaining user trust.
