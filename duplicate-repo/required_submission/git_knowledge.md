# Git research basis

## Have I used Git before?

Yes, I have used Git extensively for most of my programming-related work. This includes:

- **Team based project**, where Git helps with collaboration, conflict resolution, and branching strategies.
- **Personal project**, where I used Git to track my progress over time, experiment with new festures on branches, and safely roll back changes whnen needed.
  I typically use Git in combination with Github, which provides cloud-based remote repositories that allows me to work on whatever labtop I have, not strictly require me to work on only one device. Also it allows me to back up my work, collaborate with teammates, and submit assignment via pull requests, helping me sty organised and accountable.

## Which Git client I am using? Why?

Instead of relying on just one Git client, I combine both the Git Command Line interface (CLI) and the Graphic User Interface (GUI) features integrated in VSCode. Using the CLI allows me to have precise control over my version control workflow and develop a deeper understanding of how Git works at a fundamental level. At the same time, the GUi tools - such as the Source Control panel and Merge Editor - help me visualise changes, manage commit more intuitively, and resolve conflict with greater ease. By using both approaches together, I'm able to more more efficiently, improve the quality of my code management, and strengthen my overall Git skills.

## What are the most interesting thing I learned about Git today?

I would mention the issue I met today and how I used Git to resolve the prolem.I encountered the error message **fatal: refusing to merage unrelaled histories** when trying to pull from a remote repo that hada different commit history from my local one. I learned that this typically happens when a project is created independently or forled separately. To sesolve the issue, I used the **--allow-unrelated-histories** flag using a pull, which allows Git to merge both versions.
In addition, I gained a better understanding of how merge conflicts occur and how to resolve them using the **Merge Editor** in VSCode. Being able to compare the current changes, imcoming changes, and final result side by side made the process more intuitive. Theses experiences helped me understand Git's internal logic better and gave me more confidence when dealing with complex version control scenarios.
