## Why are PRs important in a team workflow?

Because it can help the team space to review the code (or new function) before merging them into the main branch which may bring new issue or bug; or to define whether the function is useful for the project or not.

## What makes a well structure PR?

Clear and descriptive title, detailed description of what had been changed, explaining the reason for the changes.

## What did I learn from reviewing an open-source PR?

Having a good source of example to follow which may help in the up coming project. Additionally, PR is a good concept to follow for any future coding project collaborating with others.
