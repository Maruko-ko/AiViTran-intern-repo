## What made the original code complex?
From the start, developers will not know what fixed or specific features should be used or implemented in the project. So the longer the project goes, the more code will be added.
## How did refactoring improve it?
By organzing the existing code base, it help simplify the code to make it clearer and easier to understand. It remove unnecessary complexity(naming convention or handling duplication).
