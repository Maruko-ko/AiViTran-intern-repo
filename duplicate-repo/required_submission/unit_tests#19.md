# Reflection â€“ Jest and Unit Testing

## Why is automated testing important in software development?
Automated testing helps catch bugs early, reduces the risk of regressions, and ensures that code behaves as expected after changes. It increases developer confidence, improves reliability, and speeds up the development process by avoiding manual re-checks.

## What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?
The most challenging part was setting up the testing environment correctly (configuring Jest with Babel and jsdom for React). Once configured, writing the test itself was straightforward. Understanding the difference between common matchers like `toBe`, `toEqual`, and when to use async utilities also required some learning.
