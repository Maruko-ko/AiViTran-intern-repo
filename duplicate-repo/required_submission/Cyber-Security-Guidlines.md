## Research & Learn

### Common cyber security threats in remote work environments
- **Phishing emails/messages** with malicious links or attachments.  
- **Weak or reused passwords** leading to account compromise.  
- **Unsecured Wi-Fi networks** exposing data in transit.  
- **Malware or ransomware** from unsafe downloads.  
- **Social engineering** where attackers trick employees into giving information.  

### Best practices for keeping devices and accounts secure
- Keep software and operating systems updated.  
- Use strong, unique passwords and a password manager.  
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.  
- Avoid public/unsecured Wi-Fi or use a VPN if necessary.  
- Only install software from trusted sources.  
- Lock your screen when away from your device.  

### Why lock your computer when away from your desk?
Leaving your computer unlocked risks **unauthorized access** to sensitive information. Even a short break can give others the chance to misuse accounts or data. Locking is a simple but critical habit.

### Handling phishing attempts and suspicious links
- Do not click suspicious links or download unknown attachments.  
- Verify sender details and look for red flags (typos, urgency, unfamiliar domains).  
- Report phishing attempts to the security/contact point at Focus Bear.  
- Delete the suspicious message after reporting.  

### What makes a strong password, and why use a password manager?
- **Strong passwords:** at least 12+ characters, mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
- Avoid dictionary words or personal info (birthdays, pet names).  
- A **password manager** generates, stores, and autofills unique passwords securely—removing the need to remember them all.  

### Importance of two-factor authentication (2FA)
- 2FA adds an **extra layer of protection** beyond passwords.  
- Even if a password is stolen, attackers cannot access the account without the second factor (e.g., SMS, authenticator app, biometric).  
- Should be enabled on **all work accounts and critical services**.  


## Reflection

### Security measures I currently follow
- Use unique passwords for important accounts.  
- Regularly update software and apps.  
- Lock devices manually when stepping away.  

### Areas for improvement
- Set up auto-lock on devices.  
- Migrate more accounts into a password manager.  
- Double-check suspicious emails before responding.  

### Making secure behavior a habit
- Automate security where possible (auto-lock, password manager).  
- Treat security like hygiene: consistent daily habits, not occasional checks.  
- Stay mindful when clicking links or opening attachments.  

### Steps for password/account security
- Move all accounts into a password manager.  
- Rotate older passwords to stronger alternatives.  
- Enable 2FA for every account where available.  

### If I suspect a breach or suspicious activity
1. **Stop using the device/account immediately.**  
2. **Change passwords** and revoke sessions.  
3. **Report the incident** to the Focus Bear security contact/manager.  
4. **Run security scans** or consult IT support.  


## Task

- **Enabled 2FA** on all work accounts.  
- **Reviewed passwords** and started migrating to a password manager.  
- **Configured auto-lock** on computer and phone (after a few minutes idle).  

### New Cyber Security Habit
I will **always lock my computer/phone when stepping away** and ensure 2FA is active on all accounts.  


## Key Learning
Cyber security is about **daily discipline**. Small, consistent actions—like locking devices, using 2FA, and staying alert to phishing—make the biggest difference in protecting Focus Bear’s users, team, and data.
