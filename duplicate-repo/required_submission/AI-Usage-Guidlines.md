## Why AI this important?
AI tools can **boost productivity, creativity, and problem solving**, thye must be used responsibly. Misuse such as leaking confidential data or blindly trustig AI outputs can lead to **ptivacy risk, misinformation, and reputational or legal issues**. At Focus Bear, we aim to use AI as a **supportive assistant**, not as a subtitute for critical thinking and human judgement.

## Research & Learn
### AI tools typlically used for my roels
- **Code assistance:** GutHub Copilot, ChatGT, chat Overflow's AI
- **Content drafting & editing:** ChatGPT, Grammarly
- **Research support:** AI-power search 
- **Productivity & automation:** Task summariser, AI-based testing tools
 
### Risks of using AI in a professional setting
- **Data privacy breaches** if confidential information is entered 
- **Inaccuracy / hallucinations** in generated responses
- **Bias in outputs** that may affect fairness or inclusivity
- **Over-reliance** leading to weaker personal skill development

### Information that should never be entered into AI tools
- **Confidential company data** 
- **Personally identifiable information (PII):** names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
- **Sensitive health or user data**
- **Internal credentials or security details**

### How to fact-check and validate AI-generated content
- Cross-check with **trusted sources** (docs, official references, team knowledge).  
- Look for **consistency** with existing workflows and standards.  
- Verify accuracy through **testing, peer review, or supervisor confirmation**.  

## Reflection

### When to use AI vs. my own skills
- Use AI for: brainstorming, summarizing, drafting, debugging suggestions, and generating templates.  
- Rely on my skills for: final decision-making, critical analysis, confidential work, and anything requiring domain-specific accuracy.  

### Avoiding over-reliance
- Treat AI outputs as **starting points, not final answers**.  
- Continue practicing problem-solving manually before turning to AI.  
- Always edit and adapt AI suggestions to fit Focus Bear’s context.  

### Steps to ensure data privacy
- **Never paste sensitive or confidential information** into AI tools.  
- Use anonymized or dummy data if examples are needed.  
- Follow Focus Bear’s **privacy and security policies** strictly.  
- Confirm before sharing AI-generated content externally.

## Task

### AI tool trial
I used **ChatGPT** to draft documentation guidelines.  
- The AI-generated output was **clear and structured**, but required **editing for accuracy and tone** to align with Focus Bear’s culture.  
- This confirmed that AI is useful for **first drafts**, but always requires **human review**.

### Best practice I will follow
**I will always critically review and fact-check AI outputs before sharing them, and I will never enter confidential or personal information into AI tools.**
