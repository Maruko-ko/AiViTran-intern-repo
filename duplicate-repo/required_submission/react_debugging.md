# Debugging React Applications

## What are the most common debugging techniques?
- **Console Logging (`console.log`)**: Trace values, function calls, and state updates.  
- **React DevTools**: Inspect the component tree, props, state, and hooks.  
- **Debugger Statements**: Insert `debugger;` to pause execution and inspect state in browser dev tools.  
- **Error Boundaries**: Handle unexpected crashes in components.  
- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library to detect problems early.  


## Which tools are most effective for React debugging?
- **Browser Console & DevTools**: Inspect errors, warnings, and network requests.  
- **React DevTools Extension**: Visualize props/state, track re-renders, and analyze components.  
- **VS Code Debugger**: Set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables in the editor.  
- **Error Monitoring Tools**: Use services like Sentry or LogRocket to catch runtime errors in production.  


## How do you debug issues in large React codebases?
- **Component Isolation**: Use Storybook to test and debug components independently.  
- **Consistent Logging Strategy**: Apply structured logs (with levels or tags) for readability.  
- **Centralized State Debugging**: Use Redux DevTools to track actions and state changes.  
- **Code Navigation in VS Code**: Use IntelliSense, “Go to Definition,” and global search to trace logic flow.  
- **Type Checking**: Use TypeScript or PropTypes to catch issues before runtime.  
- **Modularization**: Keep components small and reusable for easier debugging.  


## What are error boundaries and how do you handle runtime errors?
- **Error Boundaries**: Special React components that catch errors in child components and display fallback UI.  
- Prevents the whole app from crashing when one part fails.  
- Use the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method or static `getDerivedStateFromError` in class components.  
- Combine with error monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry) to log and analyze issues.  
- Wrap async code with `try/catch` to avoid unhandled rejections.  


## How do you debug performance issues using the React Profiler?
- **React Profiler** (in React DevTools):  
  - Shows render frequency and render duration for each component.  
  - Helps identify slow or frequently re-rendered components.  
- **Memoization**: Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary recalculations.  
- **Code Splitting**: Apply `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components only when needed.  
- **Network Analysis**: Inspect API calls and asset loading times in browser dev tools.  


## Summary of key debugging strategies
- Use **console logs** and **browser DevTools** for quick debugging.  
- Leverage **React DevTools + Profiler** for state and performance insights.  
- Apply **Error Boundaries** and monitoring tools to handle runtime errors gracefully.  
- Debug **large codebases** with Redux DevTools, type safety, and modular design.  
- Optimize performance with memoization, code splitting, and careful network analysis.
