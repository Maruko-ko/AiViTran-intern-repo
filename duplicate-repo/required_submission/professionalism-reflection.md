### Examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment
**Professional:**
- Being punctual for meetings, even if informal.
- Listening actively and not interrupting others.
- Using clear and respectful language in Slack/Teams messages.
- Owning up to mistakes and suggesting solutions.

- Acknowledge and appreciate contributions from others.
- Handle disagreements calmly‚Äîfocus on solving the problem, not winning the argument.
- Be mindful of cultural and time-zone differences.
- Respond to feedback with gratitude, not defensiveness.

### Giving and receiving feedback professionally
- **Giving feedback:** Focus on actions and outcomes, not personalities. Example: *‚ÄúIt would help if we documented this process for future clarity‚Äù* instead of *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre disorganized.‚Äù*  
- **Receiving feedback:** Assume positive intent, ask clarifying questions, and thank the giver.  
- Frame feedback as opportunities for growth rather than criticism.
