## Research & Learn
### How does a Kanban board work,and how does it help manage workflow?
It is a visual tool used to manage workflow by representing tasks as cards and the stgaes or work as columns. It helps teams track the status of work items, identify bottlenecks at a glance, and improve the flow of work from start to finish. Tje board promotes transparenct, as everyone can see what's  being woked on, what's next, and what's completed.
### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?
The columns typically represent stages of the workflow. Common examples include Backlog, which contains tasks that have been identified but are not yet started; Inporgress, which holds tasks actively being worked on; Blocked, which lisst tasks that connat proceed due to an issue to dependency; and Done, ehich contains tasks that have been completed and meet the agreed definition of done.
### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
From left to right as work progresses.Each team member is responsible for moving their task cards whrn they start or complete work, ensuring the board accurately reflects the current status. In collaborative situations, updates may also be made by other team members when argree upon.
### What are the benefits of limiting work in porgress (WIP)?
It ensures that the team focuses on completing tasks befire starting new ones. This reduce context-switching, prevents oveloading the team, and helps identify bottlenecks earlier.
## Reflection
### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
By making work visible and ensuring that the most important tasks are pulled inti the workflow first. The visual layout of the board alloes teams to see which items are urgent or high-value, enabling better decision making about what to work on next. By applying WIP limtis, Kanban prevent team members from taking on too many tasks at once, which reduces multitasking and the rish of delays. This focus on completing existing work before starting new items helps avoid oveload, maintains a steady pace, and ensure conssitent delivery of value.
### How can I improve my workflow using Kanban Principles?
By keeping my task board upp to date an ensuring that I only work on a few items at a time, following WIP limtis. I will pprioritise tasks based on their value and dealines, moving them across tha board as progress is made to maintain an accurate view of my workload. Additionally, I will regularly review the board to identify bottlenecks ot satlled items and address them quickly
