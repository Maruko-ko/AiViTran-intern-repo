## Research & Learn
### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional management?
Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to project management and software development that focuses on delivering value in small, usable increments and responding quickly to change. Unlike traditional **waterfall** management, where work is completed in sequential phases with fixed plans, Agile emphasizes continous collaboration, adaptability, and early delivery of working solutions This allows teams to adjust priorities and requirements as feedback is received, rather than waiting until the end of the project.
### What are the core values and principles of Agile?
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan
### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and where is each used?
- Scrum: Time-boxed sprints (1-4 weeks), defined sprint goals, structured ceremonies (planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, retrospectives), and fixed sprint commitments. Often used when work can be broken into planned increments with clear deadlines.
- Kanban: Continuous delivery with no fixed sprints, work items pulls as capacity allows, focus on visualising workflow, managing flow, and limiting WIP.Often used when priorities shift frequently or work needs continuous delivery without waiting for sprint boundaries.
### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
Because the product is actively evolving with frequent changes in priorities, small updates, and quick big fixes. Kanban's flexibility allows the team to respond to new requirements or issues immediately without waiting for the end of a sprint, which is ideal for a fast-moving startup environment.
## Reflection
### What do I think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
The biggest benefits are flexibility, faster delivery of value, and continuous feedback, which ensure the product evolves in line with user needs. Agile also promotes team collaboration and transparency. The main challenges are managing scope changes without losing focus, keeping communication clear in a fast-paced environment, and ensuring consistent quality when priorities shift often.
### How can Agile principles help improve my role and responsibilities?
As a frontend developer, by encouraging incremental delivery, so I can release smaller UI updates more frequently, get feedback earlier, and adjust quickly. The focus on collaboration ensures I work closely with designers, backend developers, and QA to refine features before completion. The principle of "working software over documentation" means I can prioritise creating functional, user-ready interfaces rather than over-investing in paperwork at the expense of progress.
## Task
### Sumarise the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in my own words
Scrum works in fixed sprints with a set goal and a planned list of tasks to complete before the sprint ends, while Kanban work continuously with tasks moving through the workflow as capacity becomes available. Scrum uses regular ceremonies like srint lanning and retrosoectives, whereas Kanban focuses on visualising work and limiting WIP to improve flow. Scrum is good for structuredm time-bound delivery; Kanban is better for ongoing, adaptive work.
### Identify one Agile principle I think will be most useful in my work
"Welcome changing requirement, even late in development" will be most useful in my role. As a frontend developer, design changes, feature tweaks, and usability improvements can come at any stage. Being open to change and adjusting quickly ensures the product UI remains user-focused and aligned with evolving needs.
