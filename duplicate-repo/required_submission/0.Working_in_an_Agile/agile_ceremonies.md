# Research and Learn
## What are the main Agile ceremonies, what is their purpose?
### Daily stand-ups:
#### Purpose: 
- Synchronise the team's work and identify any blockers early
- Promate transparency and alignment on progress toward goals
### Sprint planning (Scrum)  v.s Continuous Prioritisation (Kanban)
#### Purpose: 
- Scrum: Define the sprint goal and select backlog items to commit to for teh sprint.
- Kanban: Continually prioritise and pull the highest value warl as capacity allows 
### Retrospective: 
#### Purpose:  
- Reflecy on the previous sprint or work period to identufy improvements
- Foster continous improvement in processes, tools, and team collaboration.
### Backlog:
#### Purpose:
- Ensure the backlog is up to date, prioritised, and contains items that are well defined enough to be worked on
- Break down large items into smaller, actionable pieces

## How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across timezones?
Agile temas collaborating asynchronously and across timezones rely on clear communidation, transparent workflows, and strong documentation to stay aligned without depending entirely on real-time meetings. They use asynchronous communication tools such as Microsoft Teams, Confluence, Jira to share updates, track tasks, and document decisions so that all members cana ccess information at any time. Work is organised on shared Kanban or Scrum boards with detaiked task descriptions, acceptance criteria, and labels, ensuring visibility into progress and blockers. Teams adopt a documentation first approach, recording meeting notes, design decisions, and product demos for later review, while automation tools like CI/CD pipelines and task notifications reduce manial follow up.

# Reflection: 
## How do Agile ceremonise helps with communication and alignment?
They help communication and alignment by creating regular, structured opportunities for the team to share information, clarify priorities, and stay focused on common goals. Daily stand-up ensure everyone knows what others are working on, highlight progress, and surface blockers early, keeping short-term plans synchronised. Sprint planning and retrospective creat consistent feedback loops, encorage transparency, and ensure that decisions, dependencies, and expectations are openly communicated, keeping the team moving in the same direction.
## Which ceremony do I think is most important for my role, and why?
For my role, I believe daily stand-up meetings are the mpst important ceremony because they provide immediate visibility into what the team is working on, allow me to share my porgress, and quickly raise any blockers that could delay my tasks. Since my work often depends on or impacts others, these short daily check-ins help maintain alignment, ensure prioritises are clear, and enable rapid problem solving without waiting for longer, less frequent meetings.

## One change I want to make to improve my team collaboration:
May be proactive in sharing progress and asking clarifying questions early, even before tasks are fully underway. Since we are still in the initial stages and have not yet had much hands-on work, I will focus on building good communication habits from the start by summaising discussions, noting action points, and confirming shared understanding after meetings. This will help prevent misalignemnt and make it easier for the team to stay coordinated as work ramps up.
