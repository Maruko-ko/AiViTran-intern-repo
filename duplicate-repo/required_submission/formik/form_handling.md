# Form Handling with Formik

## How does Formik simplify form management compared to handling state manually?
Formik simplifies form handling by abstracting away the repetitive boilerplate of managing state with `useState` for each input. Instead of writing individual `onChange` and `onBlur` handlers, Formik provides `getFieldProps`, `values`, `errors`, and `touched` out of the box. This makes forms cleaner, more readable, and less error-prone.

## What are the benefits of using Formikâ€™s validation instead of writing validation logic manually?
Using Formik with Yup provides a schema-based approach to validation. This makes validation rules centralized, reusable, and easier to maintain. Instead of writing multiple `if` statements and checks for each input, Yup handles patterns (like email format) and required fields declaratively. This reduces bugs, improves readability, and makes adding or updating validation much easier.
