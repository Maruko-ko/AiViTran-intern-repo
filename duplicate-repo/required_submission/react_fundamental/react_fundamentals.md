## Why are components important in React?

Components are the **building blocks of a React application**. They allow developers to break down the UI into smaller, reusable, and independent pieces. Each component manages its own structure, styles, and behavior, making applications easier to develop, maintain, and scale.

Key reasons components are important:
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across multiple parts of the app, reducing duplication.  
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component handles one part of the UI, making the code easier to understand.  
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: By passing props, components can render different content depending on the data provided.  
- **Scalability**: Large applications are easier to manage when broken into smaller, modular components.  
- **Consistency**: Reusing the same component ensures the UI looks and behaves consistently.  

In short, components make React applications **modular, maintainable, and efficient**.
