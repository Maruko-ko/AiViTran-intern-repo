## Common issues when working wiht Lists in React
1. Missing or incorrect keys
    React requires a unique `key` prop when rendering lists. Without it, updates may cause unexpected behavior. Using `index` as a key works for simple cases but is not ideal for reordering lists.
    2. State immutability
    Directly mutating the list won't trigger re-renders. Instead, using state setters liek `setItems`
    3. Performance with large lists
    Redering very large lists can slow down the app. In such cases, techniques like windowing/virtualization help
    4. Conditional rendering issues
    Forgetting to handle empty arrays can result in redering problems
