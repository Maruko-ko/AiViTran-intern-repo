## Which terminal client I am using? Why?

Instead of relying on a single terminal client, I combine the **integrated terminal in VSCode** with its built-in **GUI toold** for certain tasks. The integrated terminal allows me to run command directly in the same environment where I write code, which keeps my workflow efficient and minimises context switching. The GUI tools in VSCode make it easier when performing the merge action instead of remembering some sort of complicated commands to solve the problem. This combination gives me both the flexibility and control of the CLI and the convenience of the GUI.

## What customizations( if any) did I make?

I set Git Bash as my default shell instead of Command Prompt or PowerShell because it supports Unix-style commands, which are wideky used in development and make it easier to follow most coding tutorials. I also applied a dark theme to improve readibility and reduce eye strain.

## What was the most useful command I learned today?

The most useful command I learned today is **`ls -al`**, which list qll files, including the hidden ones, along woth detailed information such as permissions, file size, owner, and last modified date. This command is very useful when i need to inspect project structures orcheck for hidden configuration files. Combined with **`cd`** for navigation and **`mkdir`** for creating directories, it helps me work faster and more effectively without relying entirely on the GUI.
