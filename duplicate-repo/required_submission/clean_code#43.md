## Why is breaking down functions beneficial?
It makes the code easier to follow, to read, to test. Smaller functions with shorter amount of code were written are more focused, reusable and easier to control bug's introduction. Also easier to update in the future.
## How did refactoring improve the structure of the code?
By dividing large, complex functions into smaller, focused ones, organising the code logically, and removing duplication when we(as known as developers) have already spent that much enough time on the project, we can refactor it in a better structure. This makes the codebase easier to navigate, understand, and maintain.
